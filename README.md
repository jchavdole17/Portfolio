Hi! My name is Juan Chavarria, and I am a mechanical engineering student interested in software! I like the aspect of solving puzzles and also interfacing with hardware.
This repo will show some of my project experience as I've progressed through school. If you have any questions, reach out to me at jchavarriadole@outlook.com!
