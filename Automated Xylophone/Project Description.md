# Goal
The purpose of this project was to create an automated musical instrument for a design methodology class. This project was finished in a span of 2.5 months. The requirements were for the final prototype to play 3 songs without any manual input.

# Approach
My group's approach was to actuate mallets with a solenoid to play xylophone keys. In regards to automation, we decided to not code each solenoid directly to play a song. We felt that we could make our project more versatile by connecting a digital audio workstation (DAW) to our microcontroller and play any song within our octave that way.
